## This is one of my bizarre adventure with BTWIN's 'My Bike'.

One fine Sunday, I decided to take my bike and visit 'Thotikallu falls' which is around 40 km from my home. The preparation was minimal, it was an on spot decision so I had 2 of the chikki bars (Snack bars made with groundnuts), I took that and a bottle of water and headed out.

This time I had little knowledge on how to sustain myself on longer rides, since I had never been on such long ride. I usually used to go about 10-15 km.

The first part was amazing, at times I was going all out and at slopes I reached a max speed of 60 kph. Zipping through my way to the falls. Little did I know of the misery that was about to come.

So it took around 2.5 hours to reach the falls, I had left at 9 and reached by 11:30. I sat there for 30 minutes, enjoying the falls and the bliss that comes after riding cycle for so long. I had one chikki bar, and headed my home from there.

I felt the shock, I was not able to pedal the bike on the slope regions, I had no energy in my legs, and so my struggle began. Remember the slope where I hit 60 kph, now here I took my bike in the grass and slept for a while. Then walked all the way to the peak of that slope. So and so, like a turtle I just walked all the way in the slopes and glided in the negative slopes. Got a little scared near the Bannerghatta roads. So pedaled all the way in that region in spite of the pain.

I was out of food and water, so any shop I stopped by I just kept on purchasing any fluid I got, fruit juices are helpful in such situations but shops I came across didn't have it so I had to settle for soft drinks which is the worst during such situation, but I only needed some carbohydrates.

Finally the plains came, I kept on pedaling at 15 kph, made my way through the highway and finally reached my room sweet room at about 5 PM, I closed my eyes and opened it at 10 PM.

It felt really amazing the next day in spite of so many struggles.

Only thing that I learnt from this ride is even though you are not prepared for the journey ahead, you need to improvise, utilize whatever resource you got and make best use of what you have currently.

Always be grateful for whatever you have in your life, its too short to keep complaining about what you don't have.
