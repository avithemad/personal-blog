In recent years, I have been struggling to learn and finish newer things. Here are a few reasons I found which might not be working in my favour.

### Doing too many things at the same time

Let us take a simple example of learning VIM and learning microservices at the same time.

I began learning implementing microservice with dotnet cli and using vim as source code editor. Quite simply, my brain was not able to handle doing these two things at once, at one hand I was discouraged that I am unable to use vim efficiently and on the other hand I was so much caught up in optimizing the operations I do in VIM that I was not able to focus much on the concepts I am learning for microservices.

### Not sticking to one thing for a longer period of time

This has been a childhood problem, after I see how obvious the problem is to solve for some reason I lose interest in it. The interest only lasts so long as the problem is a mystery.

I have been trying to improve on this front, and actually revisiting things even if frequency is low. I need to work on the frequency of visits. 

One of the example is this grievance app I am building. Max time I left it unvisited was 2 weeks, we need to reduce it to 3 days. Spend at least 2 hours per day towards bettering this project.


### Getting caught up in other's opinion

Respecting other's opinion is fine, but please be a bit wary of influencers opinions, as sometimes these are so biased that they also create the same biases within you. Opinion is formed when we experience something and the way out being experiences it gives different opinions, so if you have not experienced the thing and you have already created a bias within you then it feels weird when we go against it. Anyways point is, respect others opinion, but do not accept it blindly.

For example, a popular opinion in programming world I have seen is if you use a lot of mouse, there is something wrong with you. Programmers are supposed to spend most time with keyboards, and hence use VIM, CLI tools for be very fast. I preferred these tools for a long time, I used to commit, stash, merge to git repo using git-cli, try to use VIM to edit source code. I also agree that these are much powerful and efficient. But on the other hand being so fast is always not good. As our Uncle bob gives a great analogy. Suppose a doctor is operating on a patient, and he has a deadline would he be calm headed, analyzing and doing the procedure slowly, or try to be fast?

Sometimes, being slow is fine. Specially if you are doing some knowledge intensive tasks, you need to process things infront of you, recall whats needed and try to come to a solution. This all takes time, and if something is aiding me to do so, for example a git tree visualized through git lens, then great please let me use that. I want to focus on things that really do matter.
