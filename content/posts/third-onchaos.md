Chaos and order are essential for the existence. They can be seen as two faces of the same coin.

The entropy in the universe is always increasing. After the big bang, the chaos started, and out of it the solar system came out. There was an order in the way the solar systems and the planets revolved around it. Now, within the planet Earth the hydrocarbon life became a possibility and all kinds of life forms started emerging. Slowly as life evolved on this planet, the life was also came from chaos to order. There was a food chain, the humans came out of it and as intelligence developed in the humans, they started to bring order to the way they lived. The other creatures as well did, like ants, bees etc., but most of them are still out in the wild in the nature's food chain, and this diversity is necessary for the sustenance of life on Earth.

If a machine is well oiled and organized, then it behaves very well for what it was made, but this can never lead it to evolve from that state. However in case of life, if it becomes too comfortable and highly organized, there is no scope for evolution and the new entropy in the universe can never find a creative output in physical reality. Value the chaos as much as order, because chaos brings in new ways of thinking which can aid the humanity and life in new ways, being stuck in the old methods of thinking will cause a life of boredom.
