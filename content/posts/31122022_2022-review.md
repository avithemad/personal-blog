Today is the end of the year 2022, here is a brief review of the year.

## Q1 Overview

The year had begun at a low point. I was addicted to mobile legends again, and it took away 2 months just like that. Addicting to gaming at this age causes more damage than when you are young. This is the second time repeating the same mistake. Until February it went like this and then we had a wakeup call.

I was diagnosed with obesity at a height of 94 kilos and 170 cm. After getting vaccinated last year, my physical activity level went to nil. I started to walk/jog on the treadmill that my father had bought me. The doctor had suggested not to do intense weight training, which I feel was a wrong advice now. 

On YouTube, I visited a lot of self improvement channels, and binged a lot of videos from Hamza. The reason that this guy became popular was his content usually provided a bit of shock and his communication style is good. Most of this content is usually tailored for teenagers, and people of my age should actually have the ability to self motivate rather than rely on external motivation.

Within 2 months, we shed out 8 kilos and came down to 86 kilos. This part was easy, but the next kilos are a lot difficult. It is the end of the year, but still I was only able to shed just 4 more kilos and right now I am at 82 kilos. 

Most of it comes down to your eating habit. A lot of books were also read during this time. Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism, Deep work, these 2 books provided a lot of sound advice in dealing with the new world. I tried out the digital minimalism routing and trying too many other things also at the same time, due to this I was not able to follow this consistently.

## Q2 Overview

My mom went to stay with my dad, and this provided me freedom in my choice of food and workout. I bought a new cylcle Triban RC 100, and roamed around the city of Hubli a lot. You can find one of the ride [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI54q8qYmF4&ab_channel=AvinashJayakar). This is a little uncomfortable ride for me since its a road racing style posture, but i got accustomed to this. 

The following books were started in this phase with the e-reader we had
- Digital minimalism
- Essentialism
- Think straight
- Pro git
- Deep work
- Ultralearning
- The practising mind
- People ware
- Mythical man month 
- Hyperfocus
- Ultra distance cycling

I played the game Sifu, which is martial art heavy and inspired from many martial arts based movie scenes. I loved this game very much.

I went with my parent to visit Kashmir, in the summer season. It is had for some of us to bear the cold in the winter this is why we decided to visit it this season. The most memorable moment was when we removed our shoes and went through the river glacier. You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=140&v=QkmShfk8-n4&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=AvinashJayakar).

On the work side, my main partner colleague, Cijo M Jose had just left the company. It was hard to handle to load and to groom the new members. On the positive side we gradually moved from testing to development side. 

There was not much change in my weight, but overall stamina had increased and ability to cycle long distance also had increased.

## Q3 Overview

On personal front not much development, we stopped reading as many books and workout went to a halt. In the month of July we had and Angular advanced training. This helped to clear a lot of doubts around JavaScript and ngrx stuff. Action that is still pending on my side is to architect and build one proper application, not just for the sake of learning front end stuff but also to learn in deep about architecting and designing applications.

We were invited to a party event in September to our office and it was almost about 1 year. I went to a trip with 3 of my colleagues to Chickmagaluru, the origin of all coffee estates. After the trip there was a scary encounter with a drunk person. He offered me a lift and was taking me to his home, but I took over his bike and rode to place where 3 guys helped with with ola.

On the positive note, finally got to meet a lot of my colleagues and also felt amazing to work in the office after a long time. One really good thing to takeaway was if we are ever in bangalore the best time to go to office is in the morning when the workspaces are empty and our focus is at the peak. A very interesting person who could potentially be our mentor was Mr. Ramesh SS. Had really good conversations with him.

## Q4 Overview

This was the best quarter of this year. There was a change in character after encountering the scary drunk driver in Bangalore. I turned towards my favorite god _Lord Hanuman_, and decided to learn Hanuman Chalisa. Right now (29th of December) I can recite 20 stanzas of the 40, which is good. The trick was to recite it regularly which one of my good friend Mr. VedPrakash had suggested. 

I came across the IAS history teacher Mr Awadh Ojha. This guy was a serious inspiration, I attribute it to him that I got back into the practice of self improvement which includes meditation, running, praying to gods, keeping the home clean and organized, focusing on working properly. I got back into running and it was really difficult to get back, but still I have done fairly well for now, we can run 5k uninterrupted in under 32 minutes.

On the work side, it was interesting this time. We got to learn about AG grid and how to do server side implementation of pagination.

This quarter ended and began with the same place that is my birthplace meghahatuburu. We have visited Bodh gaya in the beginning of the quarter and now we visited 1 of the 13 jyotirlingas that is Deogarh. Both were really cool experiences. 

Merry christmas and a very happy new year. Hope this year brings a lot of amazing stuff in your life.

That was my year in review. Overall it was an amazing year, filled with lots of learning and outcomes.
