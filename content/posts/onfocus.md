## Why is focus needed for learning

Learning is a way to accumulate into your experience what was previously not present. Humans tend to get fulfilment when they learn complex things. In order to learn complex things, we need a certain degree of attention, alertness and concentration so our senses mental faculties are immersed into the experience we want to learn. As stuff becomes more complex so does it demand more of these resources and time in order to truly minimize the error between what we expect to achieve and what we have achieved. For example, if you are learning to play guitar and devote only 25% of these resources while learning, even if you put a lot of hours in you will to too far off what you expect from yourself, but if you atleast try to use closer to 90% of them not only you reach your ideal trajectory faster, you also get new ideas or perhaps a eureka moment where you find solution to any problem you are going through life.

Parallels between sleep and focus. In sleep there are stages, like you get drowsy first, then enter moderate and deep sleep and then something called REM sleep. In focusing as well there are stages, like initiating it and maintaining it. This is one reason why you should assign big chunks of your time focusing like 3-4 hours, because it is when you are focusing deeply you will be able to tap into that deeper and creative parts of your mind. Let us look at problems associated with them.

### Initiating focus.

This primarily takes form in procastination. It can be multiple reasons, laziness, task being hard, task being too easy. For this, may be set a timer for 5 minutes and most of the times from then on you get the momentum to start focusing and you find easier keeping on going than to stop. Perhaps sometimes it might not work, these times you will need to persevere and remember why you started to learn this thing, this is why answering this question in metalearning is so important. The answer will provide you some motivation to move foreward.

### Maintaining focus.

Sometimes once we start focusing on things, we find difficulty maintaining it. This can be variety of reasons, which we will touch upon.

But there is this notion of flow, where the task at hand is not too difficult or easy and we find easy maintaining focus and actually enjoy learning. But this is not always possible especially in bigger projects, where you might find problems/concepts too hard to solve or learn. These cases it is best to stick to deliberate practice and even though you will regress through material or go slowly, its best to procees this way rather than always aiming for a state of flow. You are kind or overloading and growing by attacking harder problems. As you spend more time on the subject you will find easier to go in state of flow. But in initial stages just keep doing deliberate practice.

Now there are 3 sources of distractions

1. Environment

   This is the most common one, and usually easier to resolve it. For any digital sources you already know how to turn off notifications and enable do not disturb modes. If any other human disturbs you, please tell them politely to not disturb you on the time slot you alotted to focus.

2. Task

   Nature of the task can sometimes be the reason for your distraction. For example reading is an active process, but it becomes passives sometimes, for example even though you are reading you might enter in a state of reading hypnosis where you are going through the words but your mind is elsewhere. Or it is sometimes difficult to focus due to feeling of exhaustion. For such times please take a short break, and come back think of it like an endurance sport. Initially it gets tiring but you can sustain longer sessions as you do it more. Also if it suits you use resources that engage you and dont keep you bored, try taking notes when watching video or reading complex topics, so you are actively engaged.

3. Mind

   This one is a bit difficult to resolve. It might be because of the emotions you are feeling due to some problems you are going through life or feel low on some days. If these are life and health problems, its best to resolve them with help of an expert. But in cases where it feels like there is no reason then please just try to initiate the focusing, and still if you feel low it would be better to relax then, maybe the central nervous system needs a bit of recharging. The more calmer your mind is easier for you to get to work, usually in eastern cultures people pray before starting an important task perhaps to calm their minds and orient themselved to the task they want to do. We could follow similar process and maybe build a ritual before starting for example meditate or pray.

The kind of focus

Arousal affects your ability to focus. Some kind of tasks require a different type of focus than others.
