A few thoughts on the concept that's been used in the anime Full Metal Alchemist : Brotherhood.

Here is what the fandom says about alchemy from the anime:

"Alchemy, It is the scientific technique of understanding the structure of matter, decomposing it, and then reconstructing it. If performed skillfully, it is even possible to create gold out of lead. However, as it is a science, there are some natural principles in place. Only one thing can be created from something else of a certain mass. This is the Principle of Equivalent Exchange."

Here are the first principles that can be understood like this:

### Comprehension

This means understanding something completely. Be it problem solving or healing someone, we need to understand the problem or ailment completely. Just think like this, in a dark room you cannot navigate so easily so your first instinct would be to light a torch if you have it or find the switch to the light bulb. We can call this process enlightenment as well, since we are shedding some light on the problem or the ailment.

### Deconstruction

Once you have comprehended something, next what comes is deconstruction.

After understanding any problem completely, now you can deconstruct is into several parts if it is huge and the problem is deconstruct-able. What I mean by that is some problems might require a single fix/solution and in these cases there is no need to deconstruct if it is simple enough, like pouring a water into glass. Also another principle which comes from the hacker culture is that if someone has already solved the problem, try to use that solution, because you want to be solving unsolved problems rather than what already has been solved. Now this deconstruction gives some more insight into the problem, just like dissecting an organism gives more insight into how body works and it makes us more confident in performing surgeries.

### Reconstruction

After the problem/ailment is completely enlightened now all you have to do is fix it or find the solution since you can see everything clearly and trust your intelligence, it analyses and produces solution much quicker when it sees everything than when everything is in the dark. So, once you are done fixing or solving the problem or healed the ailment, you need to reconstruct it and bring it back to its usable state.
