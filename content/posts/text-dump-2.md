### Happy Ganesh Chaturti

Today is Ganesh Chaturthi, fourth day after the new moon of Bhadra month. From what I have heard is Ganesh represent wisdom and hence the Elephant head on a human body to signify the amount of knowledge he possesses. He is also called Vighneswara, meaning the lord of problems. Vighna means problem, eshwars meaning god. People celebrate by bring a model made of clay to the home and worshipping with lots of flowers and sweets. Some also burst crackers in order to celebrate it with noise. It is said that we need to entertain Lord Ganesha and so lot of crackers and dance and music is done. Me personally I like to dance when sending off, its the most joyous to dance with a lot of people in a group. 7 years ago, in my first year of engineering, was my first experience to how dancing in group brings tremendous amounts of joy. Jai Ganesh, Ganapathi Bappa Maurya.

### Better call saul binge end

Better call saul came to an end. The ending felt a bit weird but was good enough. Saul was a personal created by Jimmy McGill in order to cope with all the regrets he was going through. Kim wexler had the guts to start fresh but not saul. Moral of the story face your traumas and come out of it to be a better man. Hiding it only makes you a dangerous or miserable man.

### Freelancing problems

Anyways, coming to the whats been going on last couple of days. One thing I want to get off is that freelancing I am feeling is not my cup of tea. The client I got is not collaborating well, and I feel a bit overwhelmed since I do not have a guarantee that I will be getting any money. Professional career seems fine, lot of new opportunities coming this way and learning quite new number of things, and it helps to always keep expanding the toolkit that I have. Will try to persevere and finish the job at least.

The mind is bit in a foggy state these days. One of the main reason might be because of lack of physical exercise. Lets test out if it helps in atleast clearing the fog. I feel like keeping on banging my head on the wall when any obstacle comes up. Thinking smart should be done and a strategic way needs to be found for every problem that is encountered. Any call that comes we need to spend maximum of 10 minutes, and if it takes more than that, we can ask to arrange a call for that on a scheduled time in order to get focused mind, else mind just wanders between your current task and the help that you need to provide to the team.

### Explorations

Explored stenography today, this seems an interesting way to actually write so fast. If I was proficient in this writing this blog would be a piece of cake, but I am stuck with the limit of QWERTY keyboard and my personal capability that is 60wpm. `Plover` is a great software to start out learning stenography. For depositions and transcriptions this is very helpful, since they can type it out at the speed of speaking. Writing and content creation would become really fast and approachable if we can master this technique though, so I am going to give it a try. From what I learnt, it has less than 26 keys, and each word is encoded with a chord of keystroke, so It is a bit like playing piano, and it seems like an interesting hobby to latch on to.

Yesterday night, I was going on studying event sourcing. Seems like a very interesting thing. One thing I was able to correlate to this was the git versioning. In git there is only append and read. You cannot delete or update any commit. This gives a track of what all happened and your current state is just combination of all the commits that happened. All transactions should ideally be event sourced, since it is important to have the history. System can be rolled back to previous state if something goes wrong. Updating or deleting things in database causes problem and you will need to have a separate thing to track the history of what happened to your resources. I will consider this in my future projects.

### Pro fun scene

A video call finally happened with the team, and we got to see a lot of members. This actually felt really good since its literally like you are working with virtual voices from the past few years. Seeing faces and talking to them is a different experience and enriches the conversation, since you are able to see the body language of the opposing person and catch the ques. In order to be an interesting personality we need to actually do some hard stuff, which we can say we did. I heard a bit dangerous thing which I wanted to respond to but I did not, which I feel a bit guilty for. One of my colleague while telling what happened in the weekend, said that he slept for 5 seconds when he was on a highway, and this alerted me. Usually if such a thing happens in my car a huge alarm called my Mom's voice is automatically triggered, so I thought this happens with all of em' meaning there should be atleast one person in car who is hyper aware. Usually in highways when it becomes too monotonous, our body naturally feels like sleeping. In order to avoid this I employ some techniques which you might also find helpful

- Raise the speed of the car by just about 20KMPH, this makes your amygdala alert, the ride feels a bit thrilling and you are more awake. Make the passengers in your car understand that you need to do this in order to be awake.
- Stare above the eyelids for 5-10 seconds. This technique comes from the Huberman lab podcast. This actually helps and I have tried it to stretch late nights in work as well.
  I will suggest these techniques to my colleague in the next video call that we will do.

### Improvements needed

Improvements that is needed while developing and designing a website.

- It is imperative that you have a clear head when you are trying to design the solution, because I feel the result of what you produce can be muddled by the way you think. The cleaner you think, the cleaner you write the cleaner and more organized the solution is.
- Start writing tests for the react application that you are developing. This would be a really huge improvement I feel in your developing skills since this is the only bottlenecking area that is hindering your dev speed in professional world.
- Think slow when writing code. Thinking fast often produces wrong results, updates and deletions to the codebase should happen 20% and 80% shall be reading, understanding, analyzing and communication.
